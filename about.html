  <h1>About Interlinked Aerospace</h1>
  <p>IA is an engineering company focused on building next-generation simulation tools for advanced aerospace research and development.</p>
  <p>We design modular, mission-level simulation engines that support airplane subsystem coupling across propulsion, fuel system, electrical subsystems, mechanical subsystems, avionics, aerodynamics, controls, and flight dynamics.</p>
  <p> By mission-level simulation we mean that the airplane systems interactions and performance will be evaluated and simulated in the simulated intended environment an airplane is to operate in. For example, a fighter jet that needs to do strike missions can be simulated in a 2D/3D environment with real life aircraft subsystems and air vehicle performance data simulated.
  <p>The startup is based in Texas and operates with a long-term mindset to develop a tool that solves real problems and challenges in aerospace engineering.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;">
    Fragmented tools and disconnected subsystems make airplane integration slow, manual, expert time bottle-necked, costly, and error‑prone.
