  <h1>About Interlinked Aerospace</h1>
  <p>IA is an engineering company focused on building next-generation simulation tools for advanced aerospace research and development. The startup is based in Texas and operates with a long-term mindset to develop a tool that solves real problems and challenges in aerospace engineering.</p>

  <p> Aerospace lacks a unified way to model how subsystems actually interact. SysML and MBSE tools focus on documentation, requirements, and process control, not physics or real-time coupling, so they can’t reveal how propulsion, fuel, aero, controls, and thermal behavior influence one another during a mission. 
    MDAO frameworks help optimize designs, but they orchestrate separate discipline solvers rather than providing a shared-state simulation engine where subsystems evolve together. The result is a fragmented workflow where integration happens late, manually, and with limited insight. 
    ASET Core targets the missing layer: a mission-level simulation environment that captures subsystem interactions directly, enabling engineers to evaluate full-vehicle behavior in one coherent model.

    Fragmented tools and disconnected subsystems make airplane integration slow, manual, expert time bottle-necked, costly, and error‑prone.

    ASET Core enables real-time coupling and analysis between propulsion and fuel systems and all other airplane subsystems with shared state, consistent time integration, importable data, and subsystem-level fidelity. Air vehicle data like aerodynamics can be imported for full-vehicle behavior simulation in a mission-context environment (ground, air, and ocean terrains).
