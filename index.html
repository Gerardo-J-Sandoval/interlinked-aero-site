  <h2>ASET Core Overview</h2>
  <p>ASET (AeroSystems Engineering Tool) Core is a modular, mission-level physics-based simulation engine designed to couple aircraft subsystems, propulsion, aerodynamics, controls, and vehicle dynamics within a single architecture. It does NOT reinvent the wheel as CFD, NPSS, CAD, and more specialized aerospace data can be imported for full air vehicle level simulation in one tool. It provides a clear, extensible framework for modeling aerospace systems with research-grade numerical methods. The engine is built for teams that require accuracy, modularity, and integrated aerospace vehicle analysis for both aerospace vehicle R&D and product development.</p>

  <h2>5-Year Roadmap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2026:</strong> Release prototype demo with core airplane subsystem coupling and mission-level simulation.</li>
    <li><strong>2027:</strong> Expand subsystem library (structures, guidance, thermal) and begin external pilot programs.</li>
    <li><strong>2028:</strong> Launch v1.0 with full modular architecture and documentation; initiate scramjet R&D integration.</li>
    <li><strong>2029:</strong> Collaborate with AFRL, NASA, and NRL; support advanced hypersonic mission modeling.</li>
    <li><strong>2030:</strong> Establish ASET Core as a trusted simulation platform across aerospace R&D and defense programs.</li>
  </ul>
