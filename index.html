  <p>Building the next generation of aerospace simulation.</p>
  <p><strong>ASET Core</strong> is a modular, mission-level simulation engine for high-speed aerospace R&D.</p>
  <p><a href="#philosophy">Our Team Philosophy</a></p>

  <h2 id="philosophy">Team Philosophy</h2>
  <p>We are a small, mission-driven engineering team. We hold high standards not for prestige, but because our work demands clarity, rigor, and systems thinking.</p>
  <p>We believe in respect, humility, and craftsmanship. Every person here owns meaningful parts of the engine. We collaborate deeply, communicate clearly, and support each other’s growth.</p>
  <p>We hire people who care about the mission—not people who just want a job. Anyone with curiosity, discipline, and integrity can thrive here.</p>
