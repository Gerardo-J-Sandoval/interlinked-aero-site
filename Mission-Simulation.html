    <h2>Mission Simulation for Subsystem-Level R&D</h2>
    <p>
      ASET Core enables engineers to simulate airplane and weapon subsystem behavior across realistic mission profiles.
      The focus is on propulsion, fuel, controls, thermal, mechanical, and electrical systems and not theater-level operations or orbital mechanics.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission Environment</h3>
    <p>
      Engineers can define ground, air, or ocean terrain modes with configurable weather, atmosphere, and altitude bands.
      The goal is to simulate subsystem performance under realistic environmental conditions without the overhead of global maps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standard or custom atmosphere profiles</li>
      <li>Wind, temperature, and turbulence layers</li>
      <li>Runway and carrier deck options</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mission Timeline & Events</h3>
    <p>
      Missions are structured as time-based sequences with phases like takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent.
      Engineers can introduce events such as fuel transfers, control mode changes, or subsystem degradations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Throttle schedules and power demands</li>
      <li>Subsystem transitions and failure modes</li>
      <li>Coupled simulation across all systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subsystem Coupling</h3>
    <p>
      ASET Core maintains a shared state across all subsystems, allowing real-time interaction between propulsion,
      fuel, controls, and thermal models. This reveals integration risks and performance tradeoffs that siloed tools miss.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission Outputs</h3>
    <p>
      Engineers receive time histories and summary metrics that inform design decisions and trade studies.
      Outputs focus on performance, margins, and subsystem health — not campaign outcomes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Range, endurance, and fuel reserves</li>
      <li>Thrust and power profiles</li>
      <li>Thermal and electrical loading vs. limits</li>
      <li>Subsystem health indicators</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deliberate Scope</h3>
    <p>
      ASET Core is not a replacement for STK or campaign simulators. It does not include orbital mechanics,
      global maps, or tactical coordination. Instead, it fills the missing layer between subsystem modeling and
      mission performance by staying focused, modular, and built for engineering R&D.
    </p>

<h3>Navigator — Optional Built‑In Assistant</h3>
<p>Navigator is ASET Core’s optional assistant that helps users move through mission setup, subsystem configuration, and simulation workflows with clarity. It explains errors, surfaces documentation, and highlights mission‑level insights without replacing engineering judgment.</p>
